PumpkinDB
=========

PumpkinDB is a compact event sourcing database, featuring fast on-disk storage,
flexible approach to event structure and encoding, sophisticated event indexing
and querying.

While currently it is not usable and is in process of active development, it is
a much improved descendant of [es4j](https://github.com/eventsourcing/es4j) with
regards to core ideas. It has, however, a much simpler and robust foundation and
is much easier to use from any language. You can read up on some of the ideas
and progress in this repository's tlog ("gitlog"). Simply run `git log` and find
commits with a lot of text in the message and no diffs.
